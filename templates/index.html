                    <p class="activity-writing">Recreational means "something done for recreation," and recreation, 
                        which was originally "the curing of a sick person," combines the Latin words 're', "again" and 'creare', "to create."
                        Today we think of recreational activities as curing our boredom.<br/>
                        Participating in leisure and recreation activities can help you better manage stress and reduce depression. 
                        Leisure provides you the chance to find balance in your life; it also puts you in control of how you're spending your time,
                        which is an important consideration because you may feel overwhelmed by obligations.

                    <p class="activity-writing"> Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with 
                        the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm,
                        and a variety of vocal techniques. 
                        A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist.<br/>
                        Almost anyone has the ability to sing, except for someone with damaged vocal cords,
                        but not everyone has a good singing voice. You can definitely improve your 
                        singing voice through practice and a variety of training methods.<br/>
                        Having a good voice means having a good voice throughout a song, not just now and then. 
                        It means having consistent volume, tone, pitching, support, and style at all times,
                        and it will also help to know what singing conditions are most conducive to consistent singing.

                    <p class="activity-writing"> Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. 
                        This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture.
                        Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.
                        <br/>
                        The division of dance into types can be made on many different grounds. Function (e.g., theatrical, religious, recreational)
                        is an obvious ground, but distinctions can also be made between tribal, ethnic, and folk dance,
                        between amateur and professional, and above all between different genres and styles.

                    <p class="activity-writing"> Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks),
                        expressing the author's imaginative, conceptual ideas, or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.
                        Other activities related to the production of works of art include the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic 
                        dissemination of art.
                        <br/>
                        The three classical branches of art are painting, sculpture and architecture. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts,
                        as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.
                        <br/>
                        Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of 
                        imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation. The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation,
                        are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.

                    <p class="activity-writing">Personality development is the relatively enduring pattern of the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that distinguish individuals from each other.
                        The dominant viewpoint in personality psychology indicates that personality emerges early and continues to develop across one's lifespan. Adult personality traits are 
                        believed to have a basis in infant temperament, meaning that individual differences in disposition and behavior appear early in life, potentially before language of conscious
                        self-representation develop. The Five Factor Model of personality maps onto the dimensions of childhood temperament, suggesting that individual differences in levels of the 
                        corresponding personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) are present from young ages.
